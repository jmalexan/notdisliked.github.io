        <h1>Hey there!</h1>
        <br>
        <p>My name's Jonathan, I'm currently attending Oregon State University for a degree in Computer Science.  My passion is programming, it's what I want to go into and what I do as a hobby.  My interests within programming pertain to interface design and front end programming, but I don't restrict myself to that, I explore as much as I can!  I can't put my name on anything big yet, but I have my own personal or collaborative projects which you can see on my <a class="link" href"projects.html">Projects</a> page.  I've had a few internships and jobs here or there, I'll list all those below.  Thanks for reading!</p>
